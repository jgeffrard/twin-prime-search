Unsolved problem in mathematics: Are there infinitely many twin primes?

## Description

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
According to Wikipedia, a twin prime is a prime number that is either 2 less or 2 more than another prime numberâ€”for example, either member of
the twin prime pair (41, 43). In other words, a twin prime is a prime that has a prime gap of two. Sometimes the term twin prime
is used for a pair of twin primes; an alternative name for this is prime twin or prime pair.
